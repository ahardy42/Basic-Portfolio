# Basic-Portfolio
Portfolio for first HW assignment

This Portfolio is our first HW assignment, and I am assuming will be the hosting site for our future web design projects. 

Index.html is a page about me, describing a little of my background, and letting people get to know me. 

portfolio.html is a brief display of each of my sites.  I don't have any yet, and only a few ideas for websites (for now).

contact.html is a contact form that will eventually be linked to my email so I can recieve questions and comments about the site.
